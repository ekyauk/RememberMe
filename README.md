# RememberMe
This is a memorization application an anectdote mentioned in inspired
by B. E. Skinner's paper on Programmed Instruction.

## Usage
The user first selects a quote to memorize.  They are taken to a
screen where all the letters in the quote are "greyed" out.  The user
types the first letter of the first grey word while saying the word
outloud or in his or her head.  This continues until the entire quote
is recited.

Once the user finishes reciting and typing the first letter of each
word in the quote, several words are removed from visibility and the
user must repeat the above step including the hidden words.  This
continues until the user can recite the entire quote without viewing
any of the words.
